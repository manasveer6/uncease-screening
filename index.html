                    <p>Tropical rainforests are lush and diverse ecosystems that are characterized by their high levels
                        of rainfall and consistently warm temperatures. These forests are typically found near the
                        equator and cover only about 6% of the Earth's surface, yet they contain more than half of the
                        world's plant and animal species. The dense vegetation of tropical rainforests is comprised of
                        tall trees, vines, and shrubs, which provide a complex canopy that blocks much of the sunlight
                        from reaching the forest floor. As a result, the forest floor is relatively dark and shaded,
                        which creates a unique habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species.</p>

                    <p>Tropical rainforests are essential to the health of our planet. They play a critical role in
                        regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide, which
                        helps to reduce the impact of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere. These forests also act as a
                        giant filter, cleaning the air and water of pollutants and providing a habitat for countless
                        plant and animal species. However, tropical rainforests are under threat from deforestation,
                        climate change, and other human activities, which are causing irreparable damage to these
                        precious ecosystems. Protecting and preserving these forests is crucial to the well-being of our
                        planet and all of its inhabitants.</p>

                        leaves each fall and regrow them in the spring. The dominant tree species in temperate deciduous
                        forests include oaks, maples, and beeches, among others.</p>

                    <p>Temperate deciduous forests are home to a diverse range of plant and animal species, including
                        deer, bears, squirrels, and a variety of bird species. The forest floor is often covered with a
                        rich layer of leaf litter and soil, which provides a habitat for a variety of small animals,
                        fungi, and insects. These forests also play an important role in regulating the Earth's climate,
                        acting as a carbon sink and releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. However, like many forest
                        ecosystems, temperate deciduous forests are under threat from deforestation, climate change, and

                        forests are characterized by long, cold winters and short summers, with a wide range of
                        temperatures throughout the year. The dominant tree species in boreal forests include conifers

                        mosses and lichens, which provide a habitat for a variety of small animals, fungi, and insects.

                        trees that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the intertidal zone, with roots that are able
                        to survive in both saltwater and freshwater. Mangrove forests are found in regions around the
